Assessment Task 1 – Implement the A* Pathfinding Algorithm

The tutorials for this subject discuss implementing the Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.

Take this implementation and extend it to create a working implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

Your A* pathfinding algorithm is to be written in C++.

Your program must demonstrate the use of the A* pathfinding algorithm.

You can implement the algorithm as part of a game project, or as a stand-alone demonstration program.

You may submit the same program for more than one assessment task, provided the program meets the assessment requirements for each individual assessment task. If you use the same program for multiple assessment tasks, you must upload the program to Canvas for each task.
